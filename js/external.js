// You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

// let theLittleMermaid = prompt('How many days did you rent the little mermaid?') //3
// let brotherBear = prompt('How many days did you rent Brother bear?') //5
// let hercules = prompt('How many days did you rent Hercules?') //1
// let pricePerDay = prompt('How much per day?') //3
// let totalMovieDays = theLittleMermaid + brotherBear + hercules;
// let total = pricePerDay * totalMovieDays;

//     Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350.

// let google = 300 * 6;
// console.log(google);
// let amazon = 380 * 4;
